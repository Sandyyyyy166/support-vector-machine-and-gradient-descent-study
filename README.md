The notebook included in this repository (`GD_SVD_28_Nov.ipynb`) implements the numerical algorithms required in the assignment, including:

- Gradient descent and ascent 
- Plotting the gradient descent sequences  
- Support vector machines (SVM) implementation
- SVD loss function
- Finding and plotting the minimising hyperplane
